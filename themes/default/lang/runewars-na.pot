"\tThe spawn of all that is evil and callous is the necromancer called %1. "
"The Isle of Four winds knows no individual as ruthless as he, the one "
"without emotion. Sadness, fear, anger, joy, jealousy and greed are "
"sensations that do not clutter his being, making him the most focused and "
"feared of all wizards. Death and decay are all that are required to fuel his "
"existence, they are his conscience. His aspect is a composition of energy "
"from this arcane persuasion. When looking into his shadowy eyes you can "
"almost see the tortured souls of those who have crossed his path. It is said "
"that when you meet %1, you have met death.\n"
"\tThe nature of %1's existence revolves around the magic that is found "
"within the realm of skulls. He is singularly in tune with death as a source "
"of magical essence. It is the fabric of his being. %1's unearthly aura "
"pulsates with the dark fire of death. This has become his only link to the "
"Isle of the Four Winds and for this reason %1 is limited to the use of Skull "
"magic as his source of summoning and enchantment. However, due to his "
"proximity to death, %1 is also attuned to the most destructive creatures "
"found on the Isle. He has managed to call upon the Red Dragon, the Fire "
"Elemental, and Maz'Ra the Demon Lord to do his bidding, and will not "
"hesitate to call on them throughout the next competition.\n"
"\t%1 is a true mercenary, not native to any of the races which vie for "
"control of the Isle of Four Winds. He will choose to side with races only to "
"suit his own needs, and to fortify his intensely evil magical essence. The "
"Maitha and the Marz are the only communities brave enough to have managed to "
"secure the use of %1 as an instrument in past Rune Wars. %1 will again side "
"with one of these two clans in hopes to achieve total dominance and escalate "
"his diabolic vitality.\n"
"\t%1 is somewhat of an unknown. Although he is very much alive, considerable "
"folklore has been attached to his movements. Natives to all the races on the "
"Isle have cited many reasons for his existence and continue to speculate. "
"Some say that he is an overlord to rival the Gods through constant killing "
"sprees.His wanderings across the countryside have left it dark and "
"destitute. Others believe that he is an incarnation of all that is evil. "
"What is agreed upon is that %1 is most certainly the most bizarre and most "
"fearsome individual on the island. If a wizard is to defeat him in the "
"coming competition, he or she will have to have an iron will and a heart of "
"stone, for %1 does not let up."

"\t%1 of the Kartha stands by the chivalric code of the honorable knight. All "
"that he accomplishes or attempts is for the good of his nation. His piety "
"and conviction to his people is unmatched by any other figure throughout the "
"land. %1 truly believes that there is much to be gained through patience and "
"virtue. His commitment to ethics is not a byproduct of his religious "
"beliefs, moreover, it comes from within his magical fabric. %1's dedication "
"and perseverance has allowed him to harvest his magical aura and detach "
"himself from a mundane existence. This separates him from mere ordinary "
"knights or crusaders of a church. The magic he possesses has become an "
"extension of his blade, and it flourishes within him as hones his skills as "
"a master swordsman and conjurer of good.\n"
"\tThe intense studies of the Knighthood have allowed %1 to discover a "
"greater understanding of the magic that lies deep within his soul. His "
"patience has become instinct as in the case of most Kartha clansfolk, "
"however, %1 has most certainly fortified this attribute through his machine-"
"like conviction. His magical nature lies within the power of the sword, "
"therefore all that is summoned and enchanted by %1 is attached to this "
"realm. Quite often, %1 is seen conjuring the aid of reputable heroes like "
"Carol the Great and King Drago. He especially enjoys the company of these "
"individuals because they share the sanctity that he so desperately "
"cherishes. %1 finds strength in his summonings, and for this reason, is "
"rarely seen alone.\n"
"\t%1 is misunderstood by the other races native to the Isle of Four Winds. "
"He is often considered a soft hearted individual willing to take pity on "
"those that are deemed to be less fortunate. This, however, is the wrong "
"angle to take when facing him in competition. While other wizards may expect "
"him to limit the prize of his victory, he will pursue utter dominance. His "
"absolute dedication to his people has instilled in him the will to claim a "
"landslide victory. He intends to lead his people to glory. His strength of "
"mind coupled with his unparallel sense of patience will make him a worthy "
"opponent in the coming Rune War."

"the Mage Tower for a rune war though.\n"
"\tNo one can pinpoint the moment when she became a legitimate contender "
"within the marz wizard hierarchy to be their preferred rune war mage. Her "

"\tAccording to %1, conditions for his victory are extremely ripe. His clan "
"has become somewhat negligible in the eyes the other races due to the "
"failure of past leaders to achieve success in previous Rune Wars. %1 is "
"extremely determined to surprise the other wizards at the next competition. "
"He has learned from past failure and has cited self betterment as the only "
"possible course of action that will undo what has been done to his sorry "

"delicate magical information to quench his thirst for victory. Most of his "
"magical essence is by choice self taught, having decided not to take on a "
"mentor because of the pathetic pool of past leaders and wizards. %1 is very "
"much in touch with the tides of magic which wash within his soul. He has "
"learned to tap the innate magical nature of his clansfolk. Through intense "
"magical study, %1 has discovered a way to harness the magical energy of his "
"peoples desires. He will use this as a flagship of power to exact revenge "
"over all the nations which call him weak.\n"
"\tThere is a distinct property of war which %1 holds in high regard which "
"may make him a potent foe in the next Rune War competition. %1 is a tactical "
"genius and through intense study, thought and magic, %1 has become a master "
"of tactical application. %1 has trained himself to sort and apply strategy "
"with calculating speed. He has repeated his training methods so often that "
"it has become instinct for him to adapt to different scenarios effectively. "
"%1 prides himself on lightning quick thought, and will definitely outclass "
"his opponents in this area of cerebral battle. He is able to see all "
"invisible creatures with his controversial monocle. As well, all of his "
"creatures are invisible.\n"
"\tThe nature of %1's magic is inherently versatile. Although the focus of "
"his summoning is based in the realm of skulls, he utilizes all areas of "
"tactical spell casting, enchanting his creatures with a full complement of "
"supplemental spells. %1 is never seen hoarding or saving the power that may "
"come his way during a competition. He is constantly expending his power "
"attempting to bolster his army with the various spells he has at his "
"command. %1 is a very flashy fighter who relies on speed and finesse rather "
"than pure power. He does not allow himself to be overwhelmed or overmatched. "
"His intense grasp of enchantment magic demonstrates this.\n"
"\t%1's crusade for knowledge has certainly raised the hopes of his people. "
"He can feel their excitement as the magical energies flow through his blood. "
"%1's ability to harness the hopes of his nation will make him a match for "

"\t%1 is another foreigner to the Isle of Four Winds, a human. Her intense "
"aversion to the forces of evil have attracted her to the Isle. She has been "
"following the legacy of a certain wizard in hopes of one day facing this "
"individual and banishing him from the land of the living. Orachi is the one, "
"the source of the raging tempest that blows within her passionate soul. "
"Relentless in her pursuit, %1 has finally pinpointed the whereabouts of her "

"on any commission in the coming Rune War just to oppose Orachi. Although she "
"will meet the needs of the clan who calls her, she is set on another "
"purpose. %1 wants revenge.\n"
"\tLong ago, %1 was a very passive woman, living in a small town far away "
"from the Isle of Four Winds. She pursued the study of magic half-heartedly "
"because she did not have the resources available to truly harness such "
"power. Her town was extremely mundane, a small farming reserve beside a "
"great river which the townsfolk had built their lives around. %1 was content "
"with her life, dedicated to her family and her town until one fateful day. "
"The skies suddenly darkened as an intense storm rose up and shook the "
"foundations of the town. Following the storm, an army of corpses and demons "
"entered the town, killing and spreading its curse to everything. At the "
"heart of the army was a tortured soul, a twisted man that did not show "
"emotion, Orachi the Necromancer. The town was consumed within minutes and "
"all that was once living had transformed into living dead. Orachi left as "
"quickly as he came, leaving the small farming town in ruins. %1 managed to "
"escape the torment by hiding in a small cave at the bank of the river. When "
"the sun came out and the blue sky returned she went back to town. There was "
"nothing left, even the chirping birds had been stolen by this heartless "
"being. %1 broke into a frenzy, she shed all that was pure and dedicated "
"herself to revenge. Her only course of action was to pursue the art of "
"summoning and enchantment. She turned to the only source of magic known to "
"her lands, the Demon Lord. She struck a pact with him. %1 gave him her soul "
"and in return was granted the gift of knowledge. She loathed her decision "
"but her anger cluttered her judgement, all she wanted was revenge. She had "
"become reborn as a child of fire.\n"
"\tIntense study and magical manipulation was %1's way. She nurtured the fire "
"the Demon had planted within her. Through ritual meditation, %1 fed the fire "
"of knowledge. What was once a small blaze was transformed into a hellblast "
"capable of consuming entire armies. Because of her aversion to the skull "
"magic of Orachi, the magic within her guided itself. It took on the form of "
"the sword and the number. As a result of this, %1 has become a summoner and "
"an enchanter of these two realms, and a potent force in the coming Rune War."

"all the main realms of magic; skulls, swords, and numbers. By drawing "

"how he could have possibly mastered such summoning.\n"
"\tIt has been proposed that %1 must have studied under the masters of each "

"\t%1 has adopted a strategy that is extremely effective and quite "
"frustrating to his opponents. Knowing that he can not overwhelm other "
"wizards by summoning creatures, %1 has shifted his attention to widespread "
"movement and land defense. %1 maximizes land acquisition through expert "

"minions for hit and run attacks on lands which have been left penetrable by "
"unsuspecting adversaries. The nature of his magic allows him the luxury of "
"not having to divide his attention between tactical movement and gameplay. "
"%1 can then concentrate his efforts on burying his opponents through "
"advanced rune battle strategy. The Maitha adore his approach, as they are "
"quite passive and profoundly intellectual. They have relied on %1 for many "

"Maitha will not hesitate to dissolve their pact with %1 if he wavers from "

"race and pride themselves on quick thinking and troubleshooting. It has "
"become a common sight to see %1 dazzling his opponents with brilliant play "
"and decision making, almost toying with them. %1 carries himself with a "
"cocky swagger, knowing that his play has rarely been matched in the past. He "

"%1's affiliation to a clan is torn due to his lack of a true birthright. He "
"is born of native persuasion, however, he shares the blood of two races. "
"%1's mother was a Maithan Elder and his father was a dedicated Karthan "
"Crusader, making %1 the offspring of two high ranking individuals of "
"conflicting races. While %1 received the favor of both races, sharp Maithan "
"intellect and intense Karthan dedication, he became a source of great "
"conflict. He was an incredible specimen, bred for wizardry and participation "
"in coming Rune Wars. The leaders of each of his clans recognized this and as "
"a result began vying for control of him. %1 left his home, a neutral "
"township between the two clan regions, to seek peace and to concentrate on "
"summoning and enchantment. By putting distance between himself and the "
"clans, %1 forced the leaders to take action in hopes of resolving this "
"issue. It was thought by each clan that if he were to have only one living "
"parent then %1 would become partisan to the clan of the survivor. The "
"Maithans and Karthans agreed to pit the two against each other in a mock "
"Rune War, with the loser to be put to death.. %1, still away in training, "
"did not learn of this event and continued his studies. His mother and father "
"decided it their way. They poisoned themselves and ended this horrible "
"conflict in tragedy. To this day it has been kept secret to %1 and the two "
"nations have resolved to fairly commission %1 when the Rune War comes.\n"
"\t%1's magical aura was shaped when he left his home. He sought refuge in "
"the mountains where he became one with the crisp mountain air. He dipped "
"into the magic of the air and learned to harness and control the wonders "
"contained within it. Therefore, without knowledge of a distinct realm, all "
"his summonings are related to flight and the winds. %1 became the self "
"taught master of the air, able to call upon such mystical beings as the Ki-"
"Lin, Griffon, and Air Elemental. His supplemental magic was shaped from a "
"genetic trait given to him by his father. The Karthan dedication to the "
"sword was strong within him so %1 focused on it, allowing it to bubble "
"within him, creating the substance for his enchantments.\n"
"\tIt is not known as to which clan %1 will be representing in the coming "
"Rune War. His ignorance towards the fate of his parents protects his "
"relationship with his two native clans. Until %1 discovers the truth he will "
"remain loyal to these clans, having to decide which one he will unite with. "
"If %1 is to learn of the demise of his parents, no one knows what will come "
"of the rage that will boil inside him."
