TROUBLESHOOTING:

The information below should solve many of your problems installing
or running The Isle of Four Winds: Rune War, Demo Version 1.2

Question:  Rune War refuses to install!
Answer: First, make sure you have 20 megabytes of free space on the
drive you're trying to install to.  Also, you must have WinZip, or 
some other .zip extraction program.

Question:  When I try to run runewar.exe, I get the message "Direct
Draw Init Failed"
Answer: 1: Rune War requires Direct X5.0 or better to run. This can
be obtained from "http://www.shareware.com", and type in "DirectX 5"
in the search box.  This will lead you to a list of sites from which
you can download it.
2: Your monitor and/or video card cannot support the 1024x768 
screen resolution with 256 colours required for Rune War.  If you 
monitor is not capable of this resolution, the game will not run.
Updated drivers can be obtained from your video card manufacturer
if the monitor does support this resolution.

Question: When I try to run Rune War, I get a message "dplayx.dll
missing (file not found)".
Answer: Rune War requires Direct X 5.0 or better to run.  This can
be obtained from "http://www.shareware.com", and type in "DirectX 5"
in the search box.  This will lead you to a list of sites from which
you can download it.

Question:  The timer is too fast (or too slow).
Answer: From the main menu, select the CHANGE TIMER option.  Left-click
twice on the timer setting you wish to use.
(Note: to speed up play, press SPACE to pass on a tile)

For questions concerning gameplay, consult the manual.txt
document.  It takes a while to learn to play MahJong and the Rune 
War game well, but the game gets better and better the more you 
play it.
